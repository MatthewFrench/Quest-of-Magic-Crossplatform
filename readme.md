This is a work in progress port of Quest of Magic to web and desktop using Rust.

```cargo web deploy``` does a one time build for the web.

```cargo web start``` runs a webpack server that continually builds any code changes you make. It should output a url for playing the game in the browser.

You can also build for the desktop normally.
